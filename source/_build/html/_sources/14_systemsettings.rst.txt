Select where you want the audio to be played.

(you can experiment with higher values, but then decrease the video bitrate).

If the quality from mini Jack plug does not make you happy, use audio over HDMI with an extender or attach an USB soundcard, keep in mind that when they arw big, to provide them power from an external powersource.
