MAPPING
===========


.. note::
    - **Make sure there is a cabled USB mouse connected to the PocketVJ before booting!**

    - If you use an IR mouse, you need to use an IR Keyboard to control the mapper, (CP will not work). 

    - If you use an IR mouse, you need to use an IR Keyboard to control the mapper, CP will not work.
    
    - Keyboard keys: 1,2,3,4,a,v,b,m,n,l,k,5,7,8,9,0 

    - Use a Video resolution of 1280 x 720 and a video containing an audiotrack (even silent).

    - If the mapped video stutters, decrease the bitrate and resolution or wait until it played a few times.
    - Update: with CP 3.0.3 or newer mapping will also work without USB mouse.
