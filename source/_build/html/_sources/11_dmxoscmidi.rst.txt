There are many tools on the market which can send OSC commands.
For example OSCulator or QLAB.
Make sure you are not blocked by a firewall if the command does not get through to the player

If you want to send commands from terminal
(sudo apt install liblo-tools):

``oscsend 192.168.2.100 9876 /pause``

or sendosc for all platformas: https://github.com/yoggy/sendosc

``sendosc 2.0.10.102 9876 /testscreen``
