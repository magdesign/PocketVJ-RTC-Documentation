PROJECTOR

.. image:: _images/12_CP_projector.png


.. note::  
    - Make sure to connect a PJlink compatible projector via rj45 cable
    - Default ip is: 192.168.2.254
    - Disable password and powersettings on projector
    - Some projectors act weird, this is not my fault, before complaining check if you are able to power them off from CP
    - You are able to control several projectors, give them all the same ip or add their Ip to the script
